# Kreugxr's Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website repository! This repository hosts the code for my personal website, designed to introduce visitors to who I am and what I do.

## Overview

This website serves as a presentation platform where I showcase my work, interests, and provide a brief introduction to myself. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **HTML5 Structure**: Uses modern HTML5 semantic elements for clarity and accessibility.
- **CSS Styling**: The layout and design are handled with an external CSS file (`style.css`).
- **JavaScript Interaction**: Includes JavaScript (`index.js`) for dynamic content generation.
- **Meta Tags for SEO**: Meta tags like `description`, `author`, and Open Graph tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`) are used to optimize search engine results and social media sharing.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website looks great on various devices with the `viewport` meta tag.
